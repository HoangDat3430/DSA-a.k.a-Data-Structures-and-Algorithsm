### DSA-a.k.a-Data-Structures-and-Algorithsm
# 3 Assignments in DSA course
## Assignment 1
# 1.1 Assignment’s outcome:
  After completing this assignment, students review and make good use of:
• Designing and using recursion
• Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
• List data structures
# 1.2 Introduction
  Symbol table is a crucial data structure, made and maintained by compilers to trace semantics
of identifiers (e.g information about name, type, scope, e.t.c). <br>
  Among the stages that the compiler takes to convert source code into executable code,
semantic analysis is one of the most critical stage to validate correctness of the source code,
such as checking whether a variable has been declared prior to being used, or whether the
assignment of a value to a variable is type matched, e.t.c. The semantic analysis stage demands
the symbol table in order to trace the information required in those checks. <br>
  In this assignment, students are required to implement a simulation of a record table, using
list data structures.
